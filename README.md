**R Analysis**

This folder contains the R scripts used for data processing and exploration. The scripts followed these steps:

1. **Load Libraries:** Load necessary R libraries for data manipulation and analysis.
2. **Import Data:** Establish a connection to the data in the CSV format.
3. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Clean and prepare the data for analysis, addressing missing values, inconsistencies, or transformations required for meaningful insights.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Perform EDA techniques to understand the data characteristics, identify trends, patterns, or relationships. This may involve visualizations, descriptive statistics, and statistical tests.
5. **Data Transformation:** Create new variables or modify existing ones to facilitate visualization in Tableau.
6. **Export Data:** Save the prepared datasets in a suitable format for Tableau (in this case JSON) for further analysis and visualization.
